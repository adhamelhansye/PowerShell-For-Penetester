### Adhering to standards ensures professionalism, legality, and comprehensive test coverage.

- Penetration Testing Execution Standard [PTES] (A detailed framework for organizing, documenting, and performing a penetration test).

- NIST SP 800-115 (National Institute of Standards and Technology's technical guide to information security testing and assessment).

- ISO/IEC 27001 → Information Security Management System (The international standard for managing information security).

- OWASP Testing Guide (Open Web Application Security Project's comprehensive guide for testing web application vulnerabilities).

- PCI DSS → Ensure credit card transactions (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires regular penetration testing for compliance).

- ENISA (European Union Agency for Cyber Security). It boosts trust in digital products, services and processes by drafting cybersecurity certification schemes. It cooperates with EU countries and bodies and helps prepare for future cyber challenges.
