A penetration test typically follows a structured process to ensure a comprehensive security assessment. The goal is to simulate a real-world attack to identify and safely exploit vulnerabilities.

### Basic Penetration Testing Flow

- Planning and Recon (Information gathering) 

- Scanning (Identifying network services and open ports) 

- Gaining access (Exploitation) 

- Maintaining access (Establishing persistence) 

- Analysis and Reporting (Documenting findings and providing remediation) 

### Managing and Executing a Penetration Test (Detailed)

- Define Objectives = Define Scope (Crucial for legal and ethical compliance).

- Assemble Team = Build a team of skilled professionals depending on the scope complexity.

- Planning and Preparation = Develop a detailed plan for testing methodology.

- Reconnaissance (Passive information gathering).

- Scanning & Enumeration = Active Scanning (Direct interaction with the target system to discover network topology, hosts, and services).

- Vulnerability Exploitation = Once vulnerabilities are identified → exploit them using controlled methods.

- Gaining Access and Persistence = After Exploitation → Establish a foothold for further exploitation (like installing a backdoor).

- Post Exploitation (Actions taken on the compromised host, such as collecting credentials).

- Lateral Movement = Actions that involve Privilege Escalation (gaining higher privileges on the current system) and hacking Devices on the Network (moving to other systems).

- Data analysis and reporting = Analyze the data collected during penetration testing, including vulnerabilities, exploits, and compromised systems.
