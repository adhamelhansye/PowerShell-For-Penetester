The CKC is a model developed by Lockheed Martin for understanding the stages of a cyber attack, often used by testers to ensure complete coverage.

### Using Cyber Kill Chain

1 - Recon (Profiling the target to gather information, such as organizational structure and IP ranges).

2 - Weaponization = Testers create malware or other malicious tools that help to hack the system (bundling the exploit with a backdoor).

3 - Delivery = The testers deliver the weaponized payload through attack vectors such as Phishing Emails, Social Engineering, or exploiting unpatched software.

4 - Exploitation (Executing the code to take advantage of a vulnerability).

5 - Installation = Install backdoors, trojans, or other malware to establish persistence (e.g., modifying registry keys or creating a service).

6 - Command and Control (C2) = Testers create communication channels to maintain control over the compromised systems (e.g., using DNS or HTTP tunneling).

7 - Actions on Objectives = Achieving test goals â†’ escalating privileges, data exfiltration, or disruption.
